            <p>I have been blessed by an overactive imagination and a love for learning. Here is proof:

                My Bachelor’s degree is in design, and I have a certification in UX/UI. Why? Because I love the fact that User Experience design combines creative out of the box thinking, design, and research all into one messy bundle. A messy bundle that calls for iteration, collaboration, and results that you can truly back up with proof.

                All that helped me greatly as the designer for the Linas Lithuanian school where I designed anything from pins, to a website, and ways to track school metrics so we can see how to improve the school in meaningful ways.

                But as I said, I love to learn. So now I’m taking an online bootcamp in Full Stack coding in JavaScript. So, I can not only design great interactions and experiences, but build them too. And I’ve been loving the challenges that each new topic and homework assingment have brought over the past few months.

                Now I am also a designer at Infosys + WONGDOODY and I am putting my out of the box problem solving to the best of my abilities and can't wait to see what each new day brings.

                Reach out to me if you want to nerd out (about UX, coding, DnD, hiking, or more) on here or at simona_s@outlook.com</p>
